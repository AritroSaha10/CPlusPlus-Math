# C++ Math Programs
A set of C++ Programs that can do a wide variety of math-related tasks, such as solving equations, converting equations and more.

## Current Programs
- Quadratic Trinomial Factor Machine (QTFM): Turns an equation in the form of ![x^2 + bx + c](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;x^2&space;&plus;&space;bx&space;&plus;&space;c) into ![(x+e)(x+f)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\large&space;(x\pm&space;e)(x\pm&space;f))

## Compilation and Running
As of now, this program does not require any other libraries that must be linked. No need for any other parameters unless you want the name to reflect the program

### Example Command (MinGW)
`g++ -o quadratic_trinomial_factor.exe quadratic_trinomial_factor.cpp`

## Roadmap
In the future, I'm planning on compiling the programs for WebAssembly (WA) so they can deliver results quickly and take up less space than a normal JavaScript package.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome to this repository! If you'd like, you can create an issue or pull request for bug fixes / new programs / etc and I'll check it ASAP.
